# QA Engineer Test Assignment

The purpose of this test assignment is to work as a foundation for a conversation around how you work and approach problems as a QA engineer. Please focus on how you would solve it and why. If there are things that are unclear from this task or about the product described, either reach out to us to clarify or feel free to make some assumptions where necessary.

We are not expecting you to spend more than 2 hours prepare.

## Case
Linkfire is a platform where artists and other music marketeers can create links to promote their music. The landingpages monthly serve millions of users and has to consistently drive music fans to discover and consume music and other music related content such as merchandise and concert tickets.

Example of a linkfire link:
https://lnk.to/mc5bnvVR

Among other things, some of the most important features of the landing pages are to:
- Ensure that privacy policies are enforced and consent is requested from users when necessary.
- Display the available music services and localised content based on the users geo-location. 
- Track and store events happening on the landing page, such as visits, interactions and click-throughs.

There are three teams involved in the change process, where responsibilities are divided by:
- The platform where clients can create, edit, customise and publish their links.
- Landingpages that collect link information from the Platform API and renders the page and tracks the user interactions.
- Data that is being collected and stored from the landing pages, processed and displayed as insights in the platform.
